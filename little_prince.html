<body>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <a>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</a><b>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</b>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    " What I see here is nothing but a 
    shell. What is most important is invisible..." As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile. I 
        said to myself, again:
       <c>"What moves me so deeply, about this little 
        prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower..the image 
        of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, 
        even when he is asleep... "</c>
    And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that 
    might be extingushed by a little puff of wind...
